Repository for "Dynamics of Periodic Mechanical Structures Containing Bistable Elastic Elements"

The repository contains 2 folders namely Movies and Results. The movies folder contains animations of the different regimes of wave propagation and a few additional cases. The Results folder contains the following subfolders. 

exact solution - This folder contains the mathematica file exactsolution.nb to plot the analytical solution for the solitary wave in the large amplitude case.
final figures - contains a group of figures of the simulations for the paper.
large displacements - contains the mathematica file results.nb to plot the solution for the results in the large displacement case. The Displacements.txt file contains the solution of the system for large amplitudes. Please refer to our paper for the simulation parameters.
mathematica programs - contains a few auxillary mathematica files for plotting the bistable potential in different cases and dispersion relation for small amplitudes.
medium displacements - contains the mathematica file results.nb to plot the solution for the results in the medium displacement case. The Displacements.txt file contains the solution of the system for medium amplitudes. Please refer to our paper for the simulation parameters.
precompression - contains the mathematica program of the wave propagation for large amplitudes for different values of precompression. 
small displacements - contains the mathematica file results.nb to plot the solution for the results in the small displacement case. The Displacements.txt file contains the solution of the system for small amplitudes. Please refer to our paper for the simulation parameters.
